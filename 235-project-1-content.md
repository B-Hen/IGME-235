# SNAKE GAME PROJECT

For this project I will be making a snake game. Basically the user will control the snake with wasd and  will try to make the snake bigger by collectiing pieces of the snake one by one. If the player makes the head of the snake touch any other part of the snake body they will lose. They will be special snake part where the user can grow there snake body by 3 instead of 1. If time permits I will make a power block that allows the user to have the head hit the snakes body once and they will not lose the game. For each part the user collects they will gain 10 points. For every special block that allows for faster growth of the snake body the user will gain 30 points.

## Story
In the EPIC SNAKE GAME you job is to help the snake grow so he can defend himself against natural eniemes. You start out small but over time as you eat more you body will grow larger and larger. But you are never safe to just grow, you must be careful of the smaller animals who wish to see you stay small. They will try to make you small by blowing up your body, but fear not for power ups exist to help you stay alive by making you invicible and allowing you to grow your body up to 3 times faster then normal.

## Esthetics
- Graphics style: retro
- Sound: 8-bit

In the EPIC SNAKE GAME the sound will be 8-bit. Everytime the snake collects a food block a sound que will go off. When the snake hits a speical power up like getting to grow by 3 another sound que will go off. When you collide with one of the small animal booms an expolsion sound effecct will play. Everytime the player collects a normal food block they will gain 10 points, for every power food block the player will gain 30 point, and when every the player collides with the animal boom block the player will lose 15 points. If the score every reaches below 0 the player will lose, every time the player makes the snake head hit the snake body the player will lose unless the player have a special power boost. The start screen will have instructions on it to tell the user how to move, how to start the game, and what each item is. Once in the main game there will be a score at the top left corner to display the score to the player so they can know if they are close to losing the game. Once the gameover screen is displayed there will be instructions on how tp restart the game. The background for now will be just a solid color like black, and the food blocks, power ups, snake, and animal booms will all be bright colors to contrast the dark background. THe location for now will never change. 

<!--- Gameplay --->
## Controls
- Move Up: W
- Move Left: A
- Move Dowm: S
- Move Right: D
- Pause: P
- Restart: R
- Use Power Up: SPACE

The player will be taught how to play the game through an instuction scene that is displayed before the game is started. All the controls can be found there. There will also be a pause screen that displays all the contorls as well. The gameover screen will only display instuction on how to restart the game. The player will need to learn what times are right to turn the snake body so they don't let the snake head and the snake body collide. Certain power ups will help more then others depending on the time they appear so the player needs to make sure they choose wisely. For instance a power up the allows the player to grow by 3 and a power up the slows the snakes speed, if the snakes body is very long and moving fast can cause a game over the player should choose the power up that slows the snake speed. The player will also need to learn quickly what the animal boom looks like and the best way to avoid it.
