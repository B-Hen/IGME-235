# IGME-235
A repository where all my work for IGME-235 (Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers) can be stored and worked on.

I am a second year at RIT in the Game Design and Development major. In the future I hope to be making games that are meaningful and fun for people to play for a very long time!
